// THE HOST MUST NOT KNOW. `bin/aify-env.mjs` asks this for the plugins a set of registered services
// needs and starts whatever comes back; it never names a service. That is what keeps the daemon
// general -- adding a second `aify-` service is an entry here plus a directory beside this file, and
// nothing in the host changes.
//
// A NAME IS NOT COUPLING, and the boundary gate deliberately does not treat it as such: what makes a
// module a service's own is naming its PROTOCOL -- an endpoint, a header, a request shape. This file
// maps names to factories and knows no protocol at all.
